# Hangman Game
A simple, interactive Hangman game built with React, TypeScript, and CSS Modules. The game selects a random word and lets users guess letters via their keyboard or on-screen buttons. The drawing updates as you make mistakes, and the game ends when you win or lose.
## Features
- Clean and modular codebase using components
- Win/Lose detection and message display
- Letter placeholders with conditional revealing and styling
- Random word selection from a JSON word list
- Responsive and styled keyboard layout
- Visual hangman drawing based on incorrect guesses
## How to Play
- Use your keyboard or click the letters to guess the hidden word.
- Each incorrect guess adds a new body part to the hangman drawing.
- You have **6 chances** before the drawing is complete and the game ends.
- If you guess all the letters correctly before reaching 6 incorrect guesses, you win!
- After winning or losing, the keyboard is disabled and the word is revealed.
- To play again, refresh the page.
